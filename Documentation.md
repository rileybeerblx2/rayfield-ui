# Rayfield UI
This documentation is for Rayfield Credit To Sirius And shlexware

## Booting the Rayfield Library
```lua
local Rayfield = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://sirius.menu/rayfield'))()
```




## Creating a Rayfield Window
```lua
local Window = Rayfield:CreateWindow({
   Name = "Rayfield Example Window",
   LoadingTitle = "Rayfield Interface Suite",
   LoadingSubtitle = "by Sirius",
   ConfigurationSaving = {
      Enabled = true,
      FolderName = nil, -- Create a custom folder for your hub/game
      FileName = "Big Hub"
   },
   Discord = {
      Enabled = false,
      Invite = "noinvitelink", -- The Discord invite code, do not include discord.gg/. E.g. discord.gg/ABCD would be ABCD
      RememberJoins = true -- Set this to false to make them join the discord every time they load it up
   },
   KeySystem = false, -- Set this to true to use our key system
   KeySettings = {
      Title = "Untitled",
      Subtitle = "Key System",
      Note = "No method of obtaining the key is provided",
      FileName = "Key", -- It is recommended to use something unique as other scripts using Rayfield may overwrite your key file
      SaveKey = true, -- The user's key will be saved, but if you change the key, they will be unable to use your script
      GrabKeyFromSite = false, -- If this is true, set Key below to the RAW site you would like Rayfield to get the key from
      Key = {"Hello"} -- List of keys that will be accepted by the system, can be RAW file links (pastebin, github etc) or simple strings ("hello","key22")
   }
})
```

## Creating a Tab
```lua
local Tab = Window:CreateTab("Tab Example", 4483362458) -- Title, Image
```

## Creating a Section
```lua
local Section = Tab:CreateSection("Section Example")
```

## Notifying the user
```lua
Rayfield:Notify({
   Title = "Notification Title",
   Content = "Notification Content",
   Duration = 6.5,
   Image = 4483362458,
   Actions = { -- Notification Buttons
      Ignore = {
         Name = "Okay!",
         Callback = function()
         print("The user tapped Okay!")
      end
   },
},
})
```

## Creating a Button
```lua
local Button = Tab:CreateButton({
   Name = "Button Example",
   Callback = function()
   -- The function that takes place when the button is pressed
   end,
})  
```

## Creating a toggle
```lua
local Toggle = Tab:CreateToggle({
   Name = "Toggle Example",
   CurrentValue = false,
   Flag = "Toggle1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
   Callback = function(Value)
   -- The function that takes place when the toggle is pressed
   -- The variable (Value) is a boolean on whether the toggle is true or false
   end,
})
```

## Creating a Color Picker
```lua
local ColorPicker = Tab:CreateColorPicker({
    Name = "Color Picker",
    Color = Color3.fromRGB(255,255,255),
    Flag = "ColorPicker1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
    Callback = function(Value)
        -- The function that takes place every time the color picker is moved/changed
        -- The variable (Value) is a Color3fromRGB value based on which color is selected
    end
})
```

## Creating a Slider
```lua
local Slider = Tab:CreateSlider({
   Name = "Slider Example",
   Range = {0, 100},
   Increment = 10,
   Suffix = "Bananas",
   CurrentValue = 10,
   Flag = "Slider1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
   Callback = function(Value)
   -- The function that takes place when the slider changes
   -- The variable (Value) is a number which correlates to the value the slider is currently at
   end,
})
```

## Creating An Adaptive Input (Textbox)
```lua
local Input = Tab:CreateInput({
   Name = "Input Example",
   PlaceholderText = "Input Placeholder",
   RemoveTextAfterFocusLost = false,
   Callback = function(Text)
   -- The function that takes place when the input is changed
   -- The variable (Text) is a string for the value in the text box
   end,
})
```

## Creating a Dropdown menu
```lua
local Dropdown = Tab:CreateDropdown({
   Name = "Dropdown Example",
   Options = {"Option 1","Option 2"},
   CurrentOption = {"Option 1"},
   MultipleOptions = false,
   Flag = "Dropdown1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
   Callback = function(Option)
   -- The function that takes place when the selected option is changed
   -- The variable (Option) is a table of strings for the current selected options
   end,
})
```

## Creating a Keybind
```lua
local Keybind = Tab:CreateKeybind({
   Name = "Keybind Example",
   CurrentKeybind = "Q",
   HoldToInteract = false,
   Flag = "Keybind1", -- A flag is the identifier for the configuration file, make sure every element has a different flag if you're using configuration saving to ensure no overlaps
   Callback = function(Keybind)
   -- The function that takes place when the keybind is pressed
   -- The variable (Keybind) is a boolean for whether the keybind is being held or not (HoldToInteract needs to be true)
   end,
})
```
